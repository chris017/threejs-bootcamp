# My Three.js Journey

This is my journey with Three.js, where I present my solutions to the Three.js bootcamp taught by Bruno Simon. Throughout the course, I gained knowledge on how to create 3D graphics and interactive animations using Three.js, a widely used JavaScript library for 3D graphics.

## Overview of the Bootcamp

The bootcamp is divided into different sections, each covering various aspects of Three.js development:

1. Introduction to Three.js: Learn the fundamentals of Three.js, including setting up a scene, creating geometries and materials, and adding lighting and shadows.
2. Creating 3D Objects: Learn to create different types of 3D objects such as meshes, primitives, and custom geometries.
3. Textures and Materials: Learn to apply textures and materials to 3D objects, such as creating and loading textures, using shaders, and applying bump maps and reflections.
4. Animation and Interaction: Learn to create animations and add interactivity to Three.js projects, such as using Tween.js, adding event listeners, and using physics engines.
5. Advanced Topics: Explore more advanced topics such as post-processing effects, VR and AR development, and integrating Three.js with other libraries and frameworks.

## Getting Started

To begin with this repository, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with some familiarity with Three.js. If you're new to Three.js, I recommend going through the official documentation and tutorials to get up to speed.

Once you're ready to start, you can clone this repository to your local machine and follow the code examples in each section of the bootcamp. To run the examples, you'll need to have a web server set up, as Three.js requires a web server to load external assets like textures and models.

## Bootcamp Materials

In addition to the code examples, this repository includes all necessary assets, such as textures and models, used in the bootcamp. These are located in the assets folder, organized by section and topic.

## Acknowledgements

I want to express my gratitude to Bruno Simon for creating this outstanding Three.js bootcamp and providing such comprehensive and accessible resources for learning 3D graphics and interactive animations. Additionally, I would like to thank the Three.js community for their contributions and support, which make this library a powerful tool for web development.
